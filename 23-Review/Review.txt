BaseChar.java
Everything seems pretty straightforward here!

Boys.java
The code is quite short, but everything seems to make sense. From what I can tell, it's just something that will be inherited down the line.

Gym.java / Prep.java
Very similar code in these two files. So far, you've only gotten the "negative" reactions down, but that all seems to make sense and to work out.

guilove.java
This is a bit confusing, maybe add some comments? I think this turns into a sort of map, where you click buttons that will take you to different
places in the game. You might want to comment some parts out/maybe put new names for things later, just because it might get confusing with super
generic names.

Sim.java
Pretty sure this is just the character you would play. The only issue I see is that there's no real functions in here.

Example.java
This gets quite confusing, quite quickly. Maybe it's because it's all one function, but its a little overwhelming. Nothing too terrible, though, and
the dialogue parts makes it much easier to understand the meaning of the code. You might want to put some comments or something, but I think it's fine.

map.pde
This is terrifying. I have no clue what's going on, and that might be because I don't know .pde, but I think that even if I did it would be a bit 
overwhelming. Use some more comments, maybe?

Overall, I think I understand the code fairly well.
